This page contains collection of links to other open-source projects related to platform abstraction, painting, networking and GUI development.

=Graphics (Strict)=

  * [http://www.antigrain.com/ AntiGrain] (Public Domain)
    * Template based C++ graphics toolkit.
    * Vector operations, rasterizers, containers, gradients, affine and perspective transformations.
    * Image filtering, bilinear, bicubic and more.
    * Gouraud shading. 
    * *Recommended*, always use Version 2.4 which is public domain licensed.

  * [http://cairographics.org/ Cairo] (first version BSD, LGPL)
    * Vector graphics library.
    * Doubles, gradient rendering, bilinear filtering, affine transformations.
    * PDF/Postscript output.

  * [http://www.freetype.org/ FreeType] (MIT)
    * Font rendering library.
    * Analytic rasterizer used by Antigrain and Fog.
    * LCD subpixel antialiasing.

  * [http://www.graphicsmagick.org/ GraphicsMagick] (MIT)
    * Image processing library.

  * [http://cgit.freedesktop.org/pixman/ Pixman] (MIT)
    * Pixel manipulation library.
    * Fixed point, gradient rendering, bilinear filtering, perspective transformations.
    * MMX/SSE/SSE2/ARM optimizations.

  * [http://mlab.taik.fi/~kkallio/antialiasing/ Scanline Edge-Flag Algorithm For Antialiasing] (BSD)
    * Very good rasterizer including quality settings, faster than antigrain.

  * [http://code.google.com/p/skia/ Skia] (Apache)
    * Graphics library for desktop and embedded devices.
    * Possibility to not use floating point (fixed point instead).
    * Floats, gradient rendering, bilinear filtering, perspective transformations.

=Graphics (GUI Frameworks)=
 
  * [http://www.clanlib.org/ ClanLib] (BSD)
    * Game / GUI toolkit.

  * [http://www.enlightenment.org/ Enlightenment and EFL] (BSD, LGPL)
    * Core and GUI framework and graphics libraries useful in desktop and embedded devices.
    * EVAS - Unique canvas library.
    * Imlib2 - Image reading / writing library with some basic rendering.
    * MMX/SSE optimizations.

  * [http://www.fltk.org/ FlTk] (LGPL)
    * GUI toolkit.
    * Very simple, no specific optimizations, but contains useful components and it's very small.
    * No theming, simple graphics.

  * [http://www.gtk.org/ Gtk+] (LGPL)
    * GUI toolkit.
    * PixBuf image library supporting image reading / writing.
    * Widgets and theming.

  * [http://qt.nokia.com/products Qt] (LGPL, Commercial)
    * Core and GUI framework (one of best ones).
    * Layout containers.
    * Vector graphics library with perspective transformations.
    * MMX/SSE/ARM optimizations.
    * Widgets and theming.

  * [http://www.libsdl.org/ SDL] (LGPL)
    * Gaming low-level library.
    * Additions like SDLImage, SDLgfx and others.

  * [http://ultimatepp.org Ultimate++] (BSD)
    * Core and GUI framework.
    * Layout containers.
    * Widgets and theming.

  * [http://wasabi.t0x.org/ Wasabi] (ZLIB)
    * Core and GUI framework.
    * MMX/SSE optimizations.

=Other (Libraries for Core)=

  * [http://calvados.di.unipi.it/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=ffnamespace:about FastFlow] (LGPLv3)
    * Interessting threading library

  * [http://www.fastformat.org/ FastFormat] (BSD?)
    * cool and fast formatting library
    * typesafe, threadsafe, performant

  * [http://www.pantheios.org/ Pantheios] (BSD)
    * good looking logging library

  * [http://judy.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html JudyArray] (LGPL!)
    * interessting Data Structure (but LGPL) :-(
    * faster as hash in normal situations with lesser memory usage
